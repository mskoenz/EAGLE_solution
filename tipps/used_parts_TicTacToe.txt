The following parts are needed in the TicTacToe project:

1 x ATMEGA328P_PDIP

note: PD0-PD7 is Digital Pin 0-7
      PB0-PB5 is Digital Pin 8-13 
      PC0-PC5 is Analog  Pin 0-5

3 x TAC_SWITCHPTH

note: has 4 pins but 2 each are already connected (you know this from the button, right?)
      use as INPUT_PULLUP, meaning one side to GND, other side to Digital Pin of the ATMEGA
      !one button has to connect to Pin 2 or Pin 3 bc of the interrupt to return from sleep

9 x DUOLED-RG-C

note: has common cathode (VCC)
      middle part to VCC
      outer pins to ATMEGA or PCF8574

1 x PCF8574P

note: VSS == GND
      INT doesn't need to be attached
      SCL/SDA needs to go to the ATMEGA
      set A0, A1, A2 to GND

1 x M02PTH

note: to connect the battery / one is GND the other is VCC

1 x M03PTH

note: to connect RX/TX/RST (pin 0, pin 1, pin reset) in order to program the ATMEGA on the board

1 x M04PTH

note: to connect the piezo element
      don't connect the middle two contacts
      one of the outer goes to GND or VCC and the other to a Digital Pin on the ATMEGA

1 x DIL8S

note: this is used to mount the crystal and the caps (so that you can take it out again, like the ICs). I recommend the following (or similar) layout. You don't need to add crystals or caps

XTAL1-+----O crystal O----+-XTAL2
      | x--O nothing O--x |
      |    O-+ cap   O----+
      +----O | cap   O--+---GND
             +----------+

final notes:

In schematic:
-place parts with "Add"
-connect pins with "Net" ("Wire" works also but I don't recommend)
-name your lines with "Name" (i.e. GND)
-if you want to display the name of a line use "Label"
-it's enough if two lines have the same name, the don't need to be connected visible in the schematic

In board: (file -> switch to board)
-"Route" on the bottom layer (most/all your connections should be blue not red) bc. it's easier to solder afterwards
-Correct bad "Route" with "Ripup"
-try to minimize the use of "Via" (changes from to to bottom)
-you can use the default setting with trackwidth 0.016 inch and the default grid spacing
-route all but the LEDs with the schematic-board connected
-at the end move the schematic to another folder and "Signal" and "Route" the LED on the board
-alternatively: just use "Wire" instead of "Route" in the board modus, so you don't need do disconnect the schematic/board

Finish (all in board modus):
-Adjust gray dimension square to fit the project tightly (smaller board->cheaper)
-If there is no dimension square, use "Rectangle" and draw in the dimension layer (not top or bottom)
-use "Polygon" and draw polygons on top and/or bottom that follow the gray dimension square (a polygon is only valid if the end meets the start exactly)
-Click on the "DRC" tool
-Click on load… and load the proper design rules i.e. bastli/bastli.dru
-You don't need to "check", just "select/apply"
-Now use the "Autoroute" tool and load bastli/bastli.ctl
-Hit "Ok". The polygons should now be gone and all empty areas filled with top or bottom color

Export:
-click file/CAM-Processor
-Export the different layers as follows:

TOP:
device:                GERBER_RS274X
only selected Layers:  Top, Pads, Vias
filename (convention): TOP

hit execute job (TOP and TOP.gpi are now created->TOP.gpi is not important)

BOTTOM:
device:                GERBER_RS274X
only selected Layers:  Bottom, Pads, Vias
filename (convention): BOTTOM

hit execute job (BOTTOM and BOTTOM.gpi are now created->BOTTOM.gpi is not important)

OUTLINE:
device:                GERBER_RS274X
only selected Layers:  Dimension
filename (convention): OUTLINE

hit execute job (OUTLINE and OUTLINE.gpi are now created->OUTLINE.gpi is not important)

DRILL:
device:                EXCELLON
only selected Layers:  Drill, Holes
filename (convention): DRILL

hit execute job (DRILL and DRILL.dri are now created->DRILL.dri is not important)

You need minimally a TOP or BOTTOM file as well as an OUTLINE file.

Go to http://www.gerber-viewer.com/ and load your files just to double-check them…

If all is ok->

Order:
-You have to be in the ETH network->VPN
-go to https://pcb.mueslo.de/ or search for PCB-Tool on the bastli homepage and press "Order a PCB"
-Choose Pool
-Choose for the material FR4 35u -> copper layer is 35um thick (you can bring your own material if you need something different)
-drag and drop the files onto the right slots on the homepage
-add name, phone and email and order
