The following parts are needed in the TicTacToe project:

1 x ATMEGA328P_PDIP

note: PD0-PD7 is Digital Pin 0-7
      PB0-PB5 is Digital Pin 8-13 
      PC0-PC5 is Analog  Pin 0-5

3 x TAC_SWITCHPTH

note: has 4 pins but 2 each are already connected (you know this from the button, right?)
      use as INPUT_PULLUP, meaning one side to GND, other side to Digital Pin of the ATMEGA
      !one button has to connect to Pin 2 or Pin 3 bc of the interrupt to return from sleep

9 x DUOLED-RG-C

note: has common cathode (VCC)
      middle part to VCC
      outer pins to ATMEGA or PCF8574

1 x PCF8574P

note: VSS == GND
      INT doesn't need to be attached
      SCL/SDA needs to go to the ATMEGA
      set A0, A1, A2 to GND

1 x M02PTH

note: to connect the battery / one is GND the other is VCC

1 x M03PTH

note: to connect RX/TX/RST (pin 0, pin 1, pin reset) in order to program the ATMEGA on the board

1 x M04PTH

note: to connect the piezo element
      don't connect the middle two contacts
      one of the outer goes to GND or VCC and the other to a Digital Pin on the ATMEGA

1 x DIL8S

note: this is used to mount the crystal and the caps (so that you can take it out again, like the ICs). I recommend the following (or similar) layout. You don't need to add crystals or caps

XTAL1-+----O crystal O----+-XTAL2
      | x--O nothing O--x |
      |    O-+ cap   O----+
      +----O | cap   O--+---GND
             +----------+

final notes:

In schematic:
-place parts with "Add"
-connect pins with "Net" ("Wire" works also but I don't recommend)
-name your lines with "Name" (i.e. GND)
-if you want to display the name of a line use "Label"
-it's enough if two lines have the same name, the don't need to be connected visible in the schematic

In board: (file -> switch to board)
-"Route" on the bottom layer (most/all your connections should be blue not red) bc. it's easier to solder afterwards
-Correct bad "Route" with "Ripup"
-try to minimize the use of "Via" (changes from to to bottom)
-you can use the default setting with trackwidth 0.016 inch and the default grid spacing
-route all but the LEDs with the schematic-board connected
-at the end move the schematic to another folder and "Signal" and "Route" the LED on the board
-alternatively: just use "Wire" instead of "Route" in the board modus, so you don't need do disconnect the schematic/board
